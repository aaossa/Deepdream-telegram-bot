# Deepdream

The code is a modification from [the deepdream example in the Tensorflow repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream). The code is based in the example from their jupyter notebook, and the license is the one shown in their repository. I just modified the code to use it as a module.
